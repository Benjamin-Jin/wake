Description: flexible build orchestration tool and language
 Wake is a build orchestration tool and language.
 If you have a build whose steps cannot be adequately expressed in
 make/tup/basel/etc, you probably need wake.
 If you don't want to waste time rebuilding things that don't need it,
 or that your colleagues already built, you might appreciate wake.
